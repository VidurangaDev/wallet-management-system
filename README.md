Wallet Management System
This is a simple wallet management system built with Laravel and MySQL. Users can register, log in, and manage their wallet balance, including adding money, deducting funds, and viewing their current balance. Additionally, users can view their transaction history, filter it by date and type (credit/debit), and download summary reports in PDF or CSV format.

The system also includes an admin panel, where administrators can manage users, view a list of registered users, and access individual users' transaction histories.
